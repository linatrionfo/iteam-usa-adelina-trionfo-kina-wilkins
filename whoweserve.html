            <p>Bear-O Care was founded to help care for individuals with multiple disabilities who are often turned 
                away from other facilities because of their physical disabilities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Per our policies which have been approved by the Department of Human Services, we evaluate each 
                individual for attendance. We are designed to serve those with a combination of the following: </p>

                We also consider those with cognitive delay and alternate methods of communication, however these must be accompanied by one of the above syndromes or situations.

            <p>
                Although we recognize that everyone demonstrates behaviors from time to time, we do not have a Behavior Specialist on staff and we are not approved for BC codes with DSPD. Because our population is very vulnerable, we cannot tolerate aggressive/dangerous behaviors, even if it is not typical of your child, and we do not have the ability to provide "strong-armed interventions". If you have any questions, please contact us.
